Rails app generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), created by the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) team.
This is a project created in order to help families in Berlin in finding a KiTa ( Kindergarten ) spot for their children in a saturated market where waiting list could go for months if not years. Made with Rails it proposes a solution to the chaos and uncertainty of application by setting up a direct line of communication between families and KiTas, managing them through a simple but effective dashboard.
